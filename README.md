# Don't Starve Together Dedicated Server Docker Image

This is the Docker image for DST dedicated server, based on [`debian:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/debian/).

----------

## Project Status

It's been proved working on at least 2 servers with a customizes settings. There is currently no automated tests or CI. 

Tested environments: 
  
  * An Antergos (based on Arch Linux) inside Hyper-V hypervisor in my dormitory. 
  * An DaoCloud 8x server (1GB RAM). 

## Known Issues

 * There is currently no easy way to set up Cave server using this. Working in progress. 
 * On Docker environment which doesn't support UDP port forwarding, LAN only server cannot be used. (Still you can enable Steam punchthrough and search for your server in `Online` catalog. )
 * It should be cross-platform, but OS X and Windows haven't been fully tested.

## Install Using Docker Compose

It's the recommended way for newbies. 

Create a folder for storing DST server files, then put a `docker-compose.yml` inside it, paste the following content: 
```yaml
overworld-server:
  image: jamesits/don-t-starve-together-dedicated-server:latest
  restart: always
  ports:
  - 10999:10999/udp
  volumes:
  - ./server_config:/data/DoNotStarveTogether
```
Then use `docker-compose up` to bring up the server. You can change server config in `./server_config`.

To update image, use `docker-compose pull` to update automatically. 

## Manual Installation

Do this only if you know how to use Docker and know exactly what every command means. Data is invaluable. 

### Install from Docker Hub

```shell
docker pull jamesits/don-t-starve-together-dedicated-server
```

### Install from DaoCloud

Chinese users may have a faster download speed with this way. I can't promise it will be available in a long time. 

```shell
docker pull daocloud.io/codevs/dst_server:master-init
```

Note: If you use Docker the VM way (i.e. running the image without `/data/DoNotStarveTogether` mounted to a volume or host), please be cautious:

  * All data (server settings, saved game status, etc.) will be **DELETED PERMANATELY** when deleting or updating image
  * You have to use the default server configuration or pass command line arguments by yourself

More Information please refer to [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/jamesits/don-t-starve-together-dedicated-server/).

----------

## Entrypoint Script Arguments

 * `start`: the default `CMD` to start server

## Instructions on Obtaining Server Token

Launch a steam client on a system with GUI, install Don't Starve Together, log in, press `~` button then type `TheNet:GenerateServerToken()` then press enter. You'll find a `server_token.txt` under your client config directory. (See ["References"](#references) section below for more detailed instructions. )

If you use the Docker Compose way, or have `/data/DoNotStarveTogether` mounted to your host machine, **copy the FILE** `server_token.txt` (not its content) to that folder. Also you may set token in `settings.ini`.

In other cases, you can set ENV `DST_SERVER_TOKEN` using the content of your `server_token.txt`. Just open it use any text editor and **copy the CONTENT**. Please note that if `server_token.txt` already exists, it won't be changed by startup script. 

## Modify Settings on a Volume You Don't Have Access To

 1. Create or use a Docker container which have SSH Daemon service (Like [`rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd/), but for security issues I recommend using your own image and use pubkey autiencation. )
 2. Mount your server config volume to some place of our SSH Daemon container
 3. SSH into daemon container and change settings
 4. Restart game server using `docker-compose restart`
 
Sample `docker-compose.yml` which can be appended after original one: 
```yaml
manager:
  image: rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd
  restart: always
  ports:
  - 22
  volumes:
  - ./server_config:/mnt/DoNotStarveTogether
```
